# Shark Tank Valuation Chart
## Objective
To identify the most likely valuation possible for each business category in the reality TV show Shark Tank

## Datasets used
1) Shark Tank Pitches by Rahul Sathyajit - https://www.kaggle.com/rahulsathyajit/shark-tank-pitches
2) Sharkalytics - http://sharkalytics.com/episodes

## Description
Using the relational database language SQL, we tidied the data obtained in the dataset of business pitches obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains six seasons of the reality tv show and a total of 495 companies in the dataset. Based on the SQL queries written, we created three main excel spreadsheets to develop a dashboard on Tableau Public. The end product of this project is a interactive dashboard on Tableau for potential businesses to use as a reference of the valuation they are likely to obtain from participating in the show.
